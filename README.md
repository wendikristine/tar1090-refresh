Sadly, this is a dead fork.

# Content for prod team can be found found in three places

### 1. On the `master` branch, in the `PROD_ASSETS` root-level folder

  - Icons - self-explanatory. note that each SVG file will look empty because the icons are white against a transparent background
  - Graphics - created additional versions of the altitude legend.
     - vertical, useful for mobile?
     - map dark mode with white instead of black. I also considered a script that would change the black HEX to white HEX in the SVG when the user selects a dark map. 
  - HTML/CSS - self-explanatory. For an easy diff, see [PR301](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090/pull/301)
  - Misc

### 2. dev work in context, phase 1: `clean-up-before-real-work` branch

### 3. dev work in context, phase 2: `map-controls` branch, although work was not complete
